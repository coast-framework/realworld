> ### [YOUR_FRAMEWORK] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


## How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here

## Getting started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/realworld.git
cd realworld
make db/create
make db/migrate
```

## Dev

```bash
make repl # starts an nrepl server
```

```clojure
; in your editor, connect to the nrepl server
; in atom with proto-repl, it's Ctrl+Cmd+Y then enter
; then when you're in the repl evaluate -main
(-main)
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337 # or just open it in your browser
```

## Ship
```bash
make db/migrate
make assets
make uberjar
java -jar target/realworld.jar -m server 1337
```
